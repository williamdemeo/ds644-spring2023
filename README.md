### Other Resources (optional)

These are not required but might be helpful.

+  **Online courses and videos**

   +  [Coursera][] offers many courses covering Scala, Spark, and Big Data
   ([search for "scala"](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=scala), [search for "spark"](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=spark) or [search for "big data"](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=big%20data) at the [Coursera website][Coursera]), but we especially recommend these two:

      +  [Functional Programming Principles in Scala][coursera-progfun], by Martin Odersky.
      +  [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark][coursera-bigdata], by Heather Miller.

   +  [Udemy][] offers many courses covering Scala, Spark, and Big Data as well
   

+  **Books**

   In addition to [the primary book for the course][Learning Spark], students may find the following books helpful.
   
   +  [The Scala 3 Book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html): an informal introduction to the Scala language.
   +  [The Science of Functional Programming](https://github.com/winitzki/sofp): A tutorial, with examples in Scala, by Sergei Winitzki (2022).


+  **Miscellaneous**

   +  [Volume, velocity, and variety: Understanding the three V's of big data][], David Gewirtz, 2018.
   +  [Immutability Changes Everything][], Pat Helland, 2015.


-----------------------------------

## Do I have to attend all the lectures?

Short Answer: **Yes**!

Long Answer: Students are expected to attend all classes. A grade penalty will be assessed if a student has an excessive number of absences (whether excused or unexcused). Specifically, students are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) **five** absences in total, and one must [email the instructor][email-me] if/when they miss a class. Each additional absence, and any absence not mentioned to the instructor, may result in the deduction of points from the final grade.

Occasionally attendance will be recorded at the start of class.

**Important**. If you plan to leave before class is over, or arrive more than five minutes after class has begin, the correct procedure is to inform the instruct in advance. It is impolite and disruptive to other students arrive late or leave early. It is also very distracting to the instructor and other students to begin packing up belongings before the lecture has ended.

---

## What is expected of an NJIT student?

Students must abide by [the university's code of conduct](https://www.njit.edu/dos/policies/conductcode/index.php).
In particular, **cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated**. Violations of this policy will be dealt with in a manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the university.

---

## Can I use electronic devices during lecture?

Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated to the course is not allowed.

Laptops computers may be used in the classroom *for work related to this course*.

Mobile phone use during the lecture, whether speaking or not, is not permitted, even if it is merely to send or receive text messages.  If you are using your phone during the lecture, you may be asked to leave the classroom.

As a general rule, students should silence and refrain from using electronic devices, such as phones, ipods, microwave ovens, etc. in class. There is one exception to this rule: a laptop or tablet may be used for working on something related to the course material. 

Tiktoking, Tweeting, Tindering, Facebooking, Instagramming, Snapchatting, Whatsapping, YouTubing, and gaming are strictly prohibited during the lecture.  Such activities make it hard for the student to concentrate on the lecture and can also be very distracting to other students and the instructor.  Students who violate this policy may be asked to leave the classroom.

---

## What is the grading policy?

The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Homework: 20 points total  
+ Projects: 30 points total  
+ Midterm exam: 25 points  
+ Final exam: 25 points  

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to the following table. However, the scale may be shifted (or "curved") depending on overall student performance.

+ A: 91--100  
+ B+: 86--90   
+ B: 81--85   
+ C+: 76--80  
+ C: 71--75   
+ D+: 66--70   
+ D: 60--65   
+ F:  0--59    


-----------------------------------

## Where can I find the homework?

The online homework assignments will account for 20% of the course grade and will be due roughly twice per month, unless otherwise indicated.  See the tentative [course schedule](schedule).

Students are strongly encouraged to start the homework early, so that they have time to get help from the instructor or [a tutor](#is-tutoring-available) if needed.

-----------------------------------

## Can I turn in assignments after the deadline?

**No late homework will be accepted for any reason**.  If a student fails to submit homework before the deadline, a score of 0 will be recorded for the assignment in question.

-------------------

## Is it possible to make up a missed exam?

Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, if a student misses an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if that student contacts the instructor well before the day of the exam, then it might be possible for that student to take an alternative version of the exam *before* the scheduled exam time.

To request such an alternative exam, the student must provide documented evidence of one of the following:

+ Documented medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.
+ Extra curricular activity sponsored and authorized by the university.
+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).
+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.
+ A conflict with another exam.  (In such cases the exam with the fewest students is the one that must be rescheduled.)

If a student misses an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, that student must contact the instructor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an explanation. If the excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced by 80% of the student's final exam score. For example, if the final exam score is 90%, then the student would receive a 72% for the missed test (0.80*0.90 = 0.72).

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Should I ask questions? (Slack)

Students are strongly encouraged to ask many questions!  When in doubt, ask!

1. **In Lecture**. The best time and place to ask a question is during lecture or during office hours.

2. **On** [Slack][]. Another good place to ask a question is the [Slack discussion forum for the course][Slack].  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on [Slack][].

3. **By** [email][email-me]. Students may ask questions by [emailing the instructor][email-me] or on by sending a message via Canvas.  However, the response time will likely be slower than if the question is asked on [Slack][].

**Important Remarks about electronic correspondence**

1. Do not assume the instructor knows to which class/section a question or comment pertains.  **Students should include their section number in all correspondence** (§102 for Mondays; §104 for Wednesdays).

2. To ask a question that isn't private and doesn't contain answers to homework problems, students are encouraged to post their questions in a [Slack][] channel instead of sending a direct message (DM) to the instructor.  This will save the instructor from having to answer the same question more than once.

---------------------------------

## Is tutoring available?

"YWCC and its ACM student chapter have partnered to create an online tutoring program available to undergraduate and graduate students looking for tutoring assistance."

See [computing.njit.edu/tutoring](https://computing.njit.edu/tutoring) for more information.

The undergraduate tutoring schedule is available at [computing.njit.edu/undergraduate-tutoring-1](https://computing.njit.edu/undergraduate-tutoring-1)


------------

## Can I email the instructor?

Students may [email the instructor][email-me] directly, though the response time will likely be much slower than if the question is asked on [Slack][].

If emailing the instructor, students are urged to use an informative subject field. If an email message does not at least mention the class name and section number, responses to that email may be delayed.

---------------------------------------------

## What if I have a disability?

If you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the [Office of Accessibility Resources and Services](https://www.njit.edu/studentsuccess/node/5) for information on appropriate policies and procedures. The next step is to talk to the instructor who will be happy to assist with accommodations, but **will not provide them retroactively** (so file the appropriate requests and paperwork well before the first exam!).

Students must have their paper work in order and should contact the instructor early in the semester in order to have their learning needs appropriately met.
