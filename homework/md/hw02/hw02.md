Q1. **Scala Higher-order Functions**

All parts of this question refer to the following `sum` function.

```scala
def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int = {

  }
  sumF
}
```

Q2.  Scala Pattern Matching 1.

```scala
e match { case p1 => e1 ... case pn => en }
```

Concerning the above general form of pattern matching in Scala, which of the following are true statements?

( ) Scala matches the value of the selector `e` with the patterns `p1, ..., pn` in the order in which they are written.
( ) The match expression is rewritten to the right-hand side of the first case where the pattern matches the selector `e`.
( ) References to pattern variables are replaced by the corresponding parts in the selector.
(X) All of the above.
( ) None of the above.

Q3.  Scala Pattern Matching 2.

Assuming the following Scala program:

```scala
trait Expr
case class Number(n: Int) extends Expr
case class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr

object Number{
  def apply(n: Int) = new Number(n)
}

object Sum{
  def apply(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) = new Sum(e1, e2)
}

def eval(e: Expr): Int = e match {
  case Number(n) => n
  case Sum(e1, e2) => eval(e1) + eval(e2)
}
```

What is the result of the following expression?

```scala
eval(Sum(Number(1), Number(2)))
```

( ) 0
( ) 1
( ) 2
(X) 3
( ) None of the above.

Q4. Consider the Scala code

```scala
val x = List(1,2,3)
val y = List(0, x, 4)
```

Q4.a. What is the type of `x`?

( ) `List[T]`
(X) `List[Int]`

( ) `List[Nothing]`
( ) `List[Object]`

Q4.b. What is the type of `y`?

( ) `List[T]`
( ) `List[Int]`
(X) `List[Any]`
( ) `List[Nothing]`
( ) `List(0, x, 4)` causes a run-time error.
( ) `List(0, x, 4)` causes a compile-time error.

Q4.c. What is `y.length`?

( ) 0
(X) 3
( ) 5
( ) `y.length` causes a run-time error.
( ) `y.length` causes a compile-time error.

Q4.d. What is `x == List(1, 2, y.length)`?

( ) `List(1, 2, 3)`
( ) `List(x, 1, 2, 3)`
(X) `true`
( ) `false`
( ) None of these.


Q5. Reducing lists with `foldLeft`.

Suppose you want to implement a (polymorphic) `reverse` function, which reverses the order of a given list, `xs: List[T]`, using Scala's `foldLeft` function.

You start with

```scala
def reverse[T](xs: List[T]): List[T] = (xs foldLeft ???)((ys, y) => ???)
```

Q5.a. What aspect of the code above tells you that this `reverse` function will be *polymorphic*?

( ) It operates on lists.
( ) The second `???` will be a function, so it's "higher-order."
( ) There is a folding or "reduction" operation involved.
( ) It is recursive.
(X) It takes a type parameter `T`.

Q5.b. The first set of three question marks `???` should be replaced with which of the following?

( ) `Nil`
( ) `List()`
(X) `List[T]()`
( ) `List[T](0)`
( ) `ys :: y`
( ) `y :: ys`

Q5.c. The second set of three question marks `???` should be replaced with which of the following?

( ) `Nil`
( ) `List()`
( ) `List[T]()`
( ) `List[T](0)`
( ) `ys :: y`
(X) `y :: ys`
