# DS 644: Introduction to Big Data

## Scala and Spark Setup

Please follow the link below that mentions your operating system. (If you intend to use an operating system other than Linux, Mac, or Windows, please ask the instructor whether it is okay asap!)

*  [Linux and Mac](mac-linux) (**Linux**: the preferred OS for Big Data; **Mac**: nearly as good, but not free/open-source.)

*  [Windows](windows) (Avoid, if possible.)

(**Note**. It is the opinion of your instructor that the Windows OS is sometimes useful, when there are no alternatives to choose from, for doing things like browsing the web, watching Netflix or YouTube, sending emails or texts, playing computer games, or maybe uploading a tik-tok video.  However, most serious scientists---or at least most of those scientists who know what it means to compute---do not use Windows.  Having said that, students are allowed to use Windows to (try to) complete the work in this class, but it is not recommended as your instructor will be less able to help you if you encounter problems.  And if you use Windows, you *will* encounter problems.  Please see the [Windows page](windows) for more information about using Windows in this class.)

## Getting Data

The Movie Lens datasets `ml-100k.zip` and `ml-1m.zip` (and many others) can be downloaded from the following url:

https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Another excellent source of datasets is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).

For example, the [American time use survey data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bls/american-time-use-survey) used in Project 2 is available on Kaggle.

## Packaging up a Spark project to run on a cluster

So far we have only run Spark jobs in the IDE.  We need to learn how to package up and deploy a Spark program so that it can run independently of the IDE, say, on an [AWS EMR][] cluster.

We will use the [Scala Build Tool][] ([sbt][]) to create a jar file containing our Scala program.

In the `project` folder, we need a new file called `assembly.sbt` that contains one line

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.10")
```

### Example: building a complete stand-alone Spark program

This example describes the steps required to build a stand-alone Spark program on a Linux machine.
If you're not using Linux, don't worry.  It shouldn't be too hard to read through the
example and figure out what analogous steps to follow on your architecture, and if you get stuck, ple
you can post a question on Slack.

#### Prelimiary setup: building the jar file

Let's set up a Spark project in the usual way.

This consists of 

*  Creating a new project directory.
*  Setting up the standard Spark project structure, including at least a `build.sbt` file
   and a `src/main/scala` directory where our Scala source code resides.
   (We'll call our project `movie-similarity`.)
*  We will also need a special sbt file called `assembly.sbt` which will enable us to 
   build our program into a jar file, called `MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar`.

The `MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar` file contains everything we need in order to launch our Spark 
program from the command line on a remote server that has Spark installed (e.g., an AWS EMR cluster)
by simply invoking the command `spark-submit MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar`.

Fortunately, I have already put all the files mentioned above into a zip file to make the setup easy for you. 

1.  Download the [movie-similarity.zip](examples/movie-similarity.zip) file and extract it on your machine.

2.  To build the `MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar` file, 
    +  download and install the [Scala build tool (sbt)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html),
    +  open a terminal, change to the movie-similarity project directory, and invoke the command `sbt assembly`.

       ```shell
       cd /home/your-user-name/movie-similarity
       sbt assembly
       ```

    This should create a file called `MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar` inside the `target/scala-2.12` subdirectory 
    of the main `movie-similarity` project directory. Move this newly created file up to the main project directory.

    ```shell
    mv /home/your-user-name/movie-similarity/{target/scala-2.12/,}MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar
    ```

3.  If you look in the `build.sbt` file, you will see that the version of Spark on which we want to run
    our program is **version 2.4.8**. The reason for this is that we happen to know 2.4.8 is the version 
    of Spark that's available on AWS. So, to test our `MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar` file, we need to download 
    [Spark version 2.4.8](https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.4.8/spark-2.4.8-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz) 
    from [here](https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.4.8/spark-2.4.8-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz).
    
    (If the Spark 2.4.8 download link above doesn't work for you, go to 
    https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html and find the link for the 
    [Spark release archives](https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/).)

4.  Finally, we need to download the movielens 1m dataset ([ml-1m.zip](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m.zip))
    which our Spark program will analyze.  You can download [ml-1m.zip](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m.zip) from 
    [here](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m.zip).

    (If the movielens dataset link doesn't work for you, go to https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ and find the ml-1m.zip 
    file on that page.)

    Unzip the ml-1m.zip file and put the `movies.dat` and `ratings.dat` files in the same directory as you put 
    the `MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar` file in step 1 above (e.g., the main project directory). (It doesn't really matter where you put
    the files, as long as all three of them are in the same directory.)

5.  Test the Spark program by invoking the following command (in a terminal window from the directory containing 
    the three files `MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar`, `movies.dat`, `ratings.dat`):
    
    ```shell
    ~/spark-2.4.8-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --executor-memory 1g MovieSimilarity-assembly-1.0.jar 260
    ```
    
If the job is successful, you should see something like the following in the terminal window:

```
22/12/13 22:26:53 WARN Utils: Your hostname, lampe resolves to a loopback address: 127.0.1.1; using 192.168.1.76 instead (on interface wlp2s0)

```

Then Spark will compute for about 5 or 10 minutes, after which time you should see the following output.

## Running your standalone Spark program in the cloud

### Sign up for an AWS account


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-ssh-prereqs.html


By default, Spark on an EMR cluster is configured to load data files from the
`/user/hadoop/` directory on the master cluster, so we need to create that directory
and place `movies.dat` and `ratings.dat` in there.

```
mkdir /user/hadoop
cp movies.dat ratings.dat /usr/hadoop
```

<!-- ter (e.g., `hdfs://ip-172-31-27-212.us-west-1.compute.internal:8020/user/hadoop/`/user/hadoop/ -->
