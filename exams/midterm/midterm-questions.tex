\question \textbf{Big data properties}.

  \begin{parts}
    \part In lecture we discussed the meaning of the term ``Big Data.'' We decided that, for simplicity, we will call data ``big'' when it is

    \begin{checkboxes}
    \choice at least 1Gb
    \CorrectChoice too big to fit in fast memory (cpu cache + ram) on a single compute node
    \choice too big to fit in all computer memory (whether fast or slow)
    \choice too big to be dealt with by traditional data-processing software
    \end{checkboxes}

\explain{We agreed that a good definition of ``Big Data'' for our purposes is data that is too large to fit in the fast computer memory of a single machine.  Although Wikipedia has an alternative definition---data that is ``too big to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software''---and while that definition is not wrong, it is not the definition we agreed upon in this class.}

    \part ``Big Data'' concerns which of the following types of data?

\begin{oneparcheckboxes}
\choice structured
\choice semi-structured
\choice unstructured
\CorrectChoice all of these
\end{oneparcheckboxes}

\explain{Big Data is a blanket term for the data that are too large in size and complex in nature, and which may be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured, and may also be arriving at high velocity.}

\part JSON and XML are examples of which type of data?

\begin{oneparcheckboxes}
\choice structured
\choice unstructured
\CorrectChoice semi-structured
\choice none of these
\end{oneparcheckboxes}

\explain{Semi-structured data are that which have a structure but do not fit into the relational database. Semi-structured data are organized, which makes it easier for analysis when compared to unstructured data. JSON and XML are examples of semi-structured data.}

\part Which two of the following statements are true of unstructured data?

\begin{checkboxes}
\choice It is generally easier to analyze than other types of data.
\CorrectChoice It is often referred to as ``messy'' data.
\choice It fits neatly into a schema.
\CorrectChoice It is the most widespread type of data.
\choice It is usually found in tables.

\question[9] \textbf{Latency and fault-tolerance}.

\begin{parts}

\part \textit{Latency} is degradation in performance due to...

  \CorrectChoice slow data transfer across the network or cluster
  \CorrectChoice shuffling data between different nodes in a cluster
  \choice failure of one or more nodes in the cluster
  \choice stack overflow caused by recursion
\end{checkboxes}

\part Hadoop achieves fault-tolerance by...

\begin{checkboxes}
  \choice using lazy evaluation and garbage collection.
  \CorrectChoice writing intermediate computations to disk.
  \choice keeping all data immutable and in-memory.
  \choice replaying functional transformations over the original (immutable) dataset.

\begin{checkboxes}

\CorrectChoice The second argument specifies the number of samples desired either as a fraction of the size of the RDD (\texttt{sample}) or as an absolute number (\texttt{takeSample}).
\choice There is no difference; they are just two different names one can use to invoke the same function.
